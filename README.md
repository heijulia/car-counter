Scrimba course - build a counter-app with HTML, CSS and JavaScript

To make it my own I had to change: 
- Title 
- Background image
- Font from list
- Button colors and appearance (width, border, etc)
- Wrap a div around the html, add a max width 

I also added a background with opacity-properties!
